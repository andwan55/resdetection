ML Project

Resdetection is short for "respiratory condition detection", as this model detects whether the image scans are of a healthy (normal) person, or one with pneumonia/COVID19/tuberculosis, which are all respiratory-related conditions.

The dataset used is "Chest X-Ray (Pneumonia,Covid-19,Tuberculosis)" from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtiptj/chest-xray-pneumoniacovid19tuberculosis
