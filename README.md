ML Project

Resdetection is short for "respiratory condition detection", as this model detects whether the image scans are of a healthy (normal) person, or one with pneumonia/COVID19/tuberculosis, which are all respiratory-related conditions.

The dataset used is "Chest X-Ray (Pneumonia,Covid-19,Tuberculosis)" from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtiptj/chest-xray-pneumoniacovid19tuberculosis

The related Figma file for the app concept which would utilize this model for output is: https://www.figma.com/file/4AXOBsZcf9jUU9AAwzGbyb/Respiratory-Condition-Detection-App-Concept?node-id=0%3A1
